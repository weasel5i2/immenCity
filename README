A Craftbukkit plugin enabling users to save/load arbitrary block chunks 
within their world, and then reload them at another location.  The first 
version saves them as files, but I will eventually update this project 
to use configurable web-based (PHP5) repositories instead.

CHANGELOG:

  v1.0 04-May-2011
    * Created plugin
